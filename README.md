## WUXIA / XIANXIA READERS, THIS IS FOR YOU'LL (WORK WITH ANY EPUB, OF ANY SUBJECT)

I've created this project in bolt.new.
Why did I create this? Simple: because of my love for webnovels/light novels. (Wuxia, Xianxia, Xuanhuan, and similars)

When LightNovelPub shut down due to copyright issues, I realized how fragile access to these stories can be if NovelFull broken (I'll not pay, sorry WuxiaWorld).

Fortunately, tools like a Chrome extension that converts full novels from sites like NovelFull into ePUBs still exist.
And As someone who has nearly 8GB of light novels archived, looks good to have a really good ePUB Reader with the functions ME, MYSELF, want in a website, around anothers functions that maybe someone use

Why Web? Because Firefox has Offline Automatic Translation, and Chrome has Translation too, so, you can read any light novel with ePUB-Webs, because you can automatically translate (8GB ePUBS in English, I use Chrome Extension to en>ptbr, I can read everything in portuguese without difficults, just if the english translation of webnovel is trash, if it's good, will be pretty good in portuguese too)

So I built this site

🔹Interface languages: Portuguese, Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Spanish, German, Hindi, Italian, Korean and Russian (Default: Automatic)

🔹Multiple visual themes: Choose your themes that are ideal for reading in light, dark, nighttime, or eye protection environments.

🔹Scroll button: Quickly jump to the beginning or end of the page. Can be turned on or off as desired (default is off).

🔹Read aloud (experimental): Text-to-speech feature — functional but with limited comprehension at the moment (trash asf to be honest, atleast to me).

🔹Auto-save progress: All settings and the current chapter are cached locally in browser. You can turn off your computer and come back days later — when you open the website, it will load exactly where you left off.

🔹Backup: You can export and import your data (current chapter, configuration, everything)

🔹Offline and Portable: Of course, this is 100% offline and portable. You can download Firefox Portable and Download the Translation you want. If you format your PC, you'll have your cache data saved on Firefox Portable (if you save it on PenDrive, or some partition you created/have around C:/ one you formated. Just need to use the commands below and open the website for the first time to have it 100% portable

🔹Browser Project: What this mean? Means that you can use Automatic Translation from Chrome, Firefox (have Offline Translation) and all other browser, you can read any chinese, spanish, french or any language in this world .epub in your original language for example, thanks to that
