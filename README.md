## 📖 Novel-Reader: ePUB & PDF Reader (Offline, Portable, Multi-Language)

## Wuxia / Xianxia / Xuanhuan Readers, this is for you!

A lightweight, offline, customizable reader for EPUB and PDF — built especially for webnovel and light novel fans.
I started this project out of love for Wuxia, Xianxia, Xuanhuan and light novels in general. With sites like LightNovelPub shutting down, I realized how fragile access to these stories is — so I built my own solution.

Thanks to browser translation (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), you can instantly read any novel in your language. I personally have 8GB of novels archived and can enjoy them fully translated while offline.
