## WUXIA / XIANXIA READERS, THIS IS FOR YOURS

I've created this project in bolt.new.
Why did I create this? Simple: because of my love for webnovels/light novels. (Wuxia, Xianxia, Xuanhuan, and similars)

When LightNovelPub shut down due to copyright issues, I realized how fragile access to these stories can be (I'll not pay, sorry WuxiaWorld).

Fortunately, tools like a Chrome extension that converts full novels from sites like NovelFull into EPUBs still exist.
And As someone who has nearly 8GB of light novels archived, looks good to have a really good EPub Reader with the functions ME, MYSELF, want in a website, around anothers functions that maybe someone use

Why Web? Because Firefox has Offline Automatic Translation, and Chrome has Translation too, so, you can read any light novel with Epub-Webs, because you can automatically translate (8GB epubs in English, I use Chrome Extension to en>ptbr, I can read everything in portuguese without difficults, just if the english translation of webnovel is trash, if it's good, will be pretty good in portuguese too)

So I built this site

## What it have?:

🔹Interface languages: Portuguese, Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Spanish, German and Russian (Default: Automatic)

🔹Multiple visual themes: Choose your themes that are ideal for reading in light, dark, nighttime, or eye protection environments.

🔹Text control: Adjust font size, change typeface, enable full-screen reading mode (with stretched text), normal mode, or mobile-optimized mode.

🔹Customizable interface: Options such as auto-hiding elements for more immersive reading.

🔹Bookmark system: Mark chapters as favorites with one click (quick save option enabled on configuration) or assign custom names to the bookmark.

🔹Scroll button: Quickly jump to the beginning or end of the page. Can be turned on or off as desired (default is off).

🔹Read aloud (experimental): Text-to-speech feature — functional but with limited comprehension at the moment (trash asf to be honest, atleast to me).

🔹Auto-save progress: All settings and the current chapter are cached locally in browser. You can turn off your computer and come back days later — when you open the website, it will load exactly where you left off.

🔹Backup: You can export and import your data (current chapter, configuration, everything)

🔹Offline and Portable: Of course, this is 100% offline and portable. You can download Firefox Portable and Download the Translation you want. If you format your PC, you'll have your cache data saved on Firefox Portable (if you save it on PenDrive, or some partition you created/have around C:/ one you formated. Just need to use the commands below and open the website for the first time to have it 100% portable

## ⚙️ How to Run It

Make sure you have NodeJS installed. (https://nodejs.org/en)

Open a terminal (CMD) in root folder (epub-reader folder, download the zip, unpack on some folder, open and open CMD there).

Run the following commands, in this order:

### <pre>npm install</pre>
### <pre>npm run dev</pre>

That's it! Your site will launch — fully functional, just like the preview below.

The link to access this website is something like: http://localhost:5173/
