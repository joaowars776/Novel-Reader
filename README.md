I've created this project in bolt.new.
Why did I create this? Simple: because of my love for webnovels/light novels. (Wuxia, Xianxia, Xuanhuan, and similars)

When LightNovelPub shut down due to copyright issues, I realized how fragile access to these stories can be (I'll not pay, sorry WuxiaWorld).

Fortunately, tools like a Chrome extension that converts full novels from sites like NovelFull into EPUBs still exist.
And As someone who has nearly 8GB of light novels archived, looks good to have a really good EPub Reader with the functions ME, MYSELF, want in a website, around anothers functions that maybe someone use

Why Web? Because Firefox has Offline Automatic Translation, and Chrome has Translation too, so, you can read any light novel with Epub-Webs, because you can automatically translate (8GB epubs in English, I use Chrome Extension to en>ptbr, I can read everything in portuguese without difficults, just if the english translation of webnovel is trash, if it's good, will be pretty good in portuguese too)

So I built this site

Need help with setup? Feel free to send message to me on Discord: joaowars776. I’ll gladly assist — especially if you’re new to this kind of setup and found this repository through keywords like light novel, Wuxia, or Xianxia. I'm a private server youtuber, I help around 10 to 20 peoples per month nowadays (https://youtube.com/joaowars776), it's not bothering, and I'll not request you money, just ask me, trust bro.

What it have?:

🔹Interface languages: Portuguese, Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Spanish, German and Russian (Default: Automatic)

🔹Multiple visual themes: Choose your themes that are ideal for reading in light, dark, nighttime, or eye protection environments.

🔹Text control: Adjust font size, change typeface, enable full-screen reading mode (with stretched text), normal mode, or mobile-optimized mode.

🔹Customizable interface: Options such as auto-hiding elements for more immersive reading.

🔹Bookmark system: Mark chapters as favorites with one click (quick save option enabled on configuration) or assign custom names to the bookmark.

🔹Scroll button: Quickly jump to the beginning or end of the page. Can be turned on or off as desired (default is off).

🔹Read aloud (experimental): Text-to-speech feature — functional but with limited comprehension at the moment (trash asf to be honest, atleast to me).

🔹Auto-save progress: All settings and the current chapter are cached locally in browser. You can turn off your computer and come back days later — when you open the website, it will load exactly where you left off.

🔹Backup: You can export and import your data (current chapter, configuration, everything)
